Reverse engineered [Alex Lazar's](https://github.com/lazaralex98) from Toucan (appreciate your work! 🙏) offset-helper dapp ([contracts here](https://github.com/ToucanProtocol/OffsetHelper)) while adding additional changes from my side.

Also added a simple frontend to interact with the contract ([deployed here](https://offset-helper.vercel.app/)).

NOTE: The project is experimental (the contracts aren't audited & the frontend is WIP). I'd highly recommend not interacting with it on mainnet.
